    "For automatic sea ice charting models, it can be advantageous to utilize independent SAR data over data fusion models, such as the combination of SAR and Passive Microwave Radiometers. This allows for a simple operational data pipeline, enabling ice chart production during periods when the secondary data source is not available â€“ maximizing production and speed of ice charts. However, there are difficult scenarios and ambiguities, such as SAR noise, narrow fjords, wind-roughened seas, and homogenous and landfast sea ice, that must be solved with high reliability and certainty.";

    "Professional sea ice analysts who make sea ice charts do so by interpreting microwave Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signatures and drawing polygons in a creative process with an associated set of rules. This is similar to the art of painting a portrait or a fixed object, constrained by creativity and a task without a singular correct solution. Therefore, a trivial deep learning approach that simply maps input to the output may not be a suitable technique for automating human endeavours. However, the contemporary developments of generative neural networks could be a potential avenue for automating this process in a creative and potentially unsupervised or semi-supervised way.";

This creates a thawing and melting cycle with previous solid soil contracting and expanding, respectively. Incredibly, this centimeter elevation change can be monitored from space using SAR interferometry, comparing the distance which the radar wave travels. An analysis was carried out in Western Greenland, observing in some places up to 5 cm elevation change during summer.";
